# White_matter_hyperintensities-in-Alzheimer-s-disease-patients-

Throughout this Final Degree Project an analysis has been made about the causes, symptoms, diagnoses and treatments of Alzheimer’s disease as well as its relationship with hypoxic-ischemic lesions. It has been designed a pipeline capable of segmenting these lesions present in the white matter in patients with Alzheimer’s disease. A retrospective database of 92 patients from the La Fe Hospital in Valencia was used. These patients have different levels of lesion, from Fazekas 0 to Fazekas 3. This research is carried out with the help of the research group GIBI and QUIBIM specialized in medical imaging. The designed pipeline is based on an algorithm created in Python using its libraries and the Unet code which is based on convolutional neural networks. Throughout the neuronal training, improvements are made in the code to obtain optimal results and the pipeline automatically detects hypoxic-ischemic lesions with greater precision. To do this, a validation of the algorithm will be carried out and subsequently a relationship between hypoxic-ischemic lesions and Alzheimer’s will be established based on the results obtained.
